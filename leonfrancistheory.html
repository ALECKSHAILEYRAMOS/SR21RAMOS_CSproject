       <p> In 8:11, the topics of eyes and limbs are very important, with Leon’s eye color being inconsistent, and Dante telling Ryker to ask what Leon’s true eye color is. This, as well as Dante cutting off Leon’s fingers that already had stitches on them suggests that Leon has undergone the limb swapping procedure with his fingers. <br><br>

Leon’s behavior is also very inconsistent, promising Ryker to be unafraid of death, despite Ryker mentioning that he was afraid of dying during their time together. This detail cemented the fact that Leon and Francis were the brothers from the audio and video tapes, one afraid of death and one accepting of it. Leon is both a religious man and a knowledgeable man, pointing out the anatomy of a deer skull and having precise medical knowledge. We also know that Leon has the Bible, and mentioned to have been to the Basilica before, both traits mutually exclusive to either twin.<br><br>

Outside of ingame content, game creator Dubuk has stated that neither Dante nor Vittorino have ever met Francis, yet ingame they both were present in the Basilica at this time, Dante even being the bishop's heir. If Francis was in fact the Bishop, then this makes no sense. The only plausible other option for now is that due to being his identical twin, Leon was somehow using Francis's name while posing as the bishop. <br><br>

From all of this, we can infer that how Francis lived on despite his ‘death’ was by merging his body parts somehow with Leon to live on through him, and the Basilica's bishop was in fact Leon using Francis's name. <br>
