 <p>As minor characters, Esther and Susan have little scenes in Chapter 1, yet the mystery surrounding them is  immense. First seen in Accardi’s dream in a room in the Basilica, we get the context that Susan was part of Accardi, Vittorino, Gabriel, and Juliek’s friend group back then, her even being married to Juliek. She is seen helping out Esther, who is more minor, as we only get the context that she is a nun and Susan’s friend.
<br><br>

However, in the present day, we learn that these two may have had a tragic fate. In Accardi’s POV, Juliek brings up Susan with a tone of regret, implying that she may have died or left Juliek’s life in some way, only leaving him with their daughter.

<br><br>
But in Ryker’s POV, we once again see Susan in the catacombs of the Basilica, injured in the sewers. This is the catalyst that prompts Ryker to call for help, and finally find Gabriel. Not only this, but we also see Esther earlier in the Basilica, emerging as the clock strikes 8:11, as we see her all bloodied in a wedding dress. However, she runs away before we can talk to her. As Ryker is a newcomer in the town, they clearly do not know who these two women are, but as the player, we get to see both perspectives and ask; how did they end up in these scenarios?
<br><br>
Not only that, but how did we find Susan alive yet injured after presumably a long time had passed since Juliek lost her? Are all the events happening in unison or is the Basilica playing tricks on Ryker?
