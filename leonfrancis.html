      <p style="color:white; font-family:sans-serif;"> In 8:11, the topics of eyes and limbs are very important, with Leon’s eye color being inconsistent, and Dante telling Ryker to ask what Leon’s true eye color is. This, as well as Dante cutting off Leon’s fingers that already had stitches on them suggests that Leon has undergone the limb swapping procedure with his fingers. <br><br>

Leon’s behavior is also very inconsistent, promising Ryker to be unafraid of death, despite Ryker mentioning that he was afraid of dying during their time together. This detail cemented the fact that Leon and Francis were the brothers from the audio and video tapes, one afraid of death and one accepting of it. Leon is both a religious man and a knowledgeable man, pointing out the anatomy of a deer skull and having precise medical knowledge. We also know that Leon has the Bible, and mentioned to have been to the Basilica before, both traits mutually exclusive to either twin.<br><br>

From all of this, we can infer that how Francis lived on despite his ‘death’ was by merging his body parts somehow with Leon to live on through him.
