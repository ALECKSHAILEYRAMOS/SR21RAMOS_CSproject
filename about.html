<p> Surreal horror game 8:11â€™s mysteries are plenty, and this only serves, for many fans, to deepen the interest in it. Both as a stylistic choice, with game creator Dubuk stating himself that he prefers stories to be more ambiguous, and a result of the original game concept being split up into 2 chapters, with the first chapter being the one currently out and playable, with Chapter 2 being worked on currently.<br><br>


 Due to this, there are many unconfirmed and missing details in the expansive lore of the game. Mysteries that were supposed to be wrapped up in the second part of the game are still inconclusive.  Finding out these mysteries are one of the major hooks of the game right now, with an active community dedicated to figuring out the story from the hints we have now, and this site serves as an archive to popular theories and unsolved mysteries circulating currently. (This archive contains plausible theories with evidence as well as mysteries that currently do not have a lead or are too vague to figure out with current details. This is for the purpose of gathering lore-relevant information in one place to use as a reference.)<br><br><br>
