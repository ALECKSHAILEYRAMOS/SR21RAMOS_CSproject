 <p>Gabriel’s death at the hands of Leon’s Bible is surrounded by mysterious circumstances. In Ryker’s visit to Rosso Cadere, they find out that Gabriel has returned, albeit without his memories. He states that he woke up in Rosso, with no recollection of anything, a generally lower retention of memory, and some differing traits from before he died.

   <br><br>

In the segment of the game where we play as him, we meet Vittorino in the catacombs and we discover that Vittorino and Gabriel knew each other before his death. Everyone that knew him was unaware of the details of his death, since Ryker (and possibly Dante) was the only person to actually witness his death.Vittorino suspects that Gabriel’s return is correlated to a new “generation”. This is the last we see of Gabriel in Chapter 1.

   <br><br>

As someone with presumably little ties to the Basilica, how was he able to return through unnatural circumstances? As we know right now, aside from his connection to Vittorino, he was relatively uninvolved with the happenings of the Basilica. How did he get involved with Dante’s goal to kill Leon and were his ties to Dante or him opening the Bible related to how he’s alive once again?
