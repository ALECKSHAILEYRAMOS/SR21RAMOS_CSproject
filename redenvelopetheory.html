        <p> Recommended to read the Merge theory before this !   <br><br>

        One of the letters that Ryker finds in the Basilica and later translated by Juliek, this letter includes symbolism and vital hints to what happened during the closing act of the Basilica. <br><br>

"You are going to going to wake up alarmed, and alone. I have returned you to your true home. White dove, I have traded you with the black sheep. I can't admit that I hurt you. My selfishness got the best of me, and I hurt you. I've chosen another to take your place, as I can't bring myself to torture you any further." <br> <br>

This letter is most likely penned by Francis himself, Juliek mentioning that the Bishop wanted his men to knonw German as others in Rosso had difficulties with the language and this could help them communicate privately. The wording of the letter is intentionally vague, addressed to a "white dove", and mentioning that this white dove has been traded with another person, the "black sheep". Whatever the author intended for the receiver seems to be a horrible fate, using terms like "I do not wish to torture you any further.", however states that their intention was to bless the both of them.<br><br>
        
While there is no confirmation on the character involved, we can find the most possible characters through common symbolism and context clues. The author of the letter would most likely only be Francis/Leon (depending on when the merge happened). However, who is the recipient of the letter? The location this letter is found in features a prominent glass window with a white dove. This room as well is most likely Vittorino's room, with canvases of his paintings seen around. Birds of any kind are also associated with Vittorino, with the room Gabriel meets him in having pigeon corpses, him being described as having the eyes of a hawk, etc. <br><br>

The black sheep, however, has less leads, however there is reason to believe that it is Dante. Throughout the only two locations where we see Dante physically present, there is roaming sheep, and Dante is seen in a dream sequence with ram horns. It is plausible as well since Dante is related to Francis. Due to this, some have speculated this was the cause for his death and/or transformation into an angel.
