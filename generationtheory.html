       <p> The usage of the word “generation” comes up multiple times during the game, and its meaning is still unconfirmed. The first time this term comes up is Vittorino talking to Gabriel, mentioning “another generation” in speculation to how he was able to return to life. The second instance of this term is said by Dante, with his goal being to make “a new generation”. 
<br><br>
This term, from this context, could mean two things: a body or incarnation, or a parallel plane of reality. 
<br><br>
Evidence that points to this term referring to a body is the nature of both Gabriel and Dante, whereas Gabriel’s previous body had been killed by looking at Leon’s Bible, Dante, as well, is in a state of being where, as an angel who is mentioned to have been murdered while he was human, might not have a permanent body as well, as near the end of the game, he says his "time has run out", before his form spontaenously combusts. The most we see of him is in a dream reality, near the end of the game. The creator, Dubuk, has also stated that the form we see him in at the beginning and at the end are two separate bodies. His goal of making a new generation could be to create a permanent form for himself once again. 
<br><br>
However, evidence that points to the term being used to describe a parallel reality can be seen many times in the game. The game has many themes of dream vs reality, puzzles like arranging two sides of a room to be symmetrical and other occurrences that support the existence of other or parallel realities. 
<br><br>
Dialogue from angel characters that support Ryker during the events of the game also refers to this, with Beetle saying that they are special due to their existence not being duplicated across realities, only being singular. It is also mentioned in the tapes and by Dante of geometric shapes that could make up these realities, lines such as “Picture your reality in the shape of a square.” and “You’re the one that acted on the First Sphere.” However, in this context, there is currently less known motivation on why Dante would have such a large scale plan as to why he would try to make a new reality.
