      <h2> TIMELINE:</h2>
      <p>

An unknown amount of time ago, two twins named Leon and Francis were raised in France. Due to their parents each wanting a surgeon and a priest, Francis took on the role of a priest and Leon the doctor. However, while Leon was on a hunting trip with their father, he saw disturbing phenomena that led to him tripping and accidentally firing the shot through their father’s head. After relaying the news to Francis, who already had a condition of his vision failing depending on his mental state, became permanently blind due to the trauma. <br><br>

<br><br>

Many of the events between this point remain unknown, however important things to note are Leon acquiring a book of forbidden medical procedures, stating that ‘God spoke to him directly through the book, and he allowed Him to touch his spine and bless him” , and Francis gets promoted to a Bishop.<br><br>

Around 20~ years ago in Rosso Cadere (set vaguely in Europe, due to the presence of French, German, and Italian characters and meaning ‘red fall’ in Italian.), the town’s Basilica named Eclisse di Sole reopens its gates, blessed by Bishop Francis. The Basilica is a major attraction in Rosso Cadere, and it acts as an open sanctuary for anyone. However, there seems to be more sinister things at play, with the Basilica quickly being overcrowded, and disturbing and unnatural events occurring. One of the priests at the time was Vittorino, describing their situation as “being stuffed into cages like rabbits.” <br><br>

Authorities abused their power as well, however problems at the Basilica turned far more dark when catacombs were suddenly discovered under the Basilica, with no one having built them. People also begin to notice that the layout of the Basilica was unpredictable and changes suddenly, by only escaping successfully out of pure desperation. <br><br>

Amidst all of these happenings, Francis was the head surgeon of the medical unit at the Basilica. The procedures he performed were based on aforementioned forbidden medical procedures, specifically the swapping of limbs. These surgical procedures usually led to even more strange happenings, with a patient dubbed 0267 having his eyes swapped, then puking black sludge and falling into a coma. After a few weeks, he wakes up at 8:11 PM, rambling about how he saw ghosts that told him how he would die. Francis’s heir, presumably the next Bishop to be, was Dante Basilio. Dante also assisted in these procedures, being described to be as sick as Francis but without the ill intent, only going along with his word. <br><br>

However, Francis, from the perspective of the general populace of the Basilica, dies (about 15 years ago from the point of the current game). Despite this, many of the priests at the church do not really believe he is dead, and presume that Dante’s disappearance and presumed death is due to him.<br><br>

After all of this, the Basilica finally closes, with only Vittorino staying in the abandoned Basilica.<br><br><br>

Current Game:<br><br>

A year ago from the current story is where the game begins. Leon and Ryker seek shelter at a French Church where Leon notes that it seems different than other abandoned places they have been to before. As it turns midnight, Leon surprises Ryker with a cake for their 29th birthday, and tells them to meet him at the main area of the church to receive their ordination as a priest. However, as Ryker makes their way there, they encounter Leon bleeding from a chest wound. Before telling Ryker to hide in one of the confession booths, Leon entrusts his Bible to them. <br><br>

Suddenly, he is dragged into another room by Dante Basilio. After an unspecified amount of time, Ryker emerges from the confession booth to see Leon’s corpse, killed by a shot through the head. Panicked and seeking guidance, Ryker prays to the Virgin Mary and receives a message; a piece of paper with the coordinates of Rosso Cadere. <br><br>

Meanwhile, Gabriel is discussing with Dante over the phone. Gabriel seems to have been tracking Leon from before they went into the church and relaying information to Dante, however did not know that he was accompanied by Ryker. Ryker runs into Gabriel and asks for his help, however drops Leon’s Bible in their panicked state. Gabriel opens the Bible and starts to read it, causing the environment to shift unnaturally before his head explodes. Ryker retrieves the Bible and runs.<br><br>

A year later, they arrive at Rosso Cadere to continue their mission to find out the cause of Leon’s death and exact revenge. Asking for the directions to the Basilica, the townspeoples’ main reaction is anger, saying that the Basilica was cursed. After meeting two other characters named Accardi and Juliek in Rosso Cadere, Ryker proceeds to the Basilica.<br><br>

While exploring the Basilica, Ryker finds evidence of the medical malpractice and other strange happenings that occured in the Basilica, as well as discovering the strangeness surrounding the time of 8:11 (PM or AM). However, their visit is cut short when a priest who seemingly resides in the abandoned Basilica kicks Ryker out, mentioning that whoever trespasses into the Basilica has a curse set upon them and that in 2 weeks they would soon die.<br><br>

Upon going back to their hotel room, Ryker notices their Bible is missing, and thus returns back to the Basilica in order to retrieve it. They find themselves witnessing even more horrific imagery in the catacombs of the Basilica. Once they finally retrieve it, they get hit by a car in their hurry to get back to the motel rooms.<br><br>

In a dream state, Ryker meets Beetle, an tall entity with a Beetle mask, and discovers Dante’s name.<br><br>

Once coming to, Ryker notices that the driver of the car was no other than Accardi, who they met briefly while asking directions to the Basilica. While injured, Ryker does not have enough funds to go to a hospital and thus instead asks to be dropped off at their motel. <br><br>

Accardi arrives at his friend Juliek’s home, and we get to see that both men are also friends with Vittorino and have been for a number of years. We also find out that Accardi eats people.

The next day, Ryker returns to the Basilica to seek out more clues. While there, they hear a voice calling out for help from the sewers, and look down to see a woman bleeding from her head in the sewers. They run to find help. They find Gabriel, seemingly revived and having no memory of what happened, living as a local detective. Ryker does not remember or realize who he is either. Upon arriving back at the place where they saw the woman, there is no trace of what Ryker saw, however when showing the phone they acquired to Gabriel reveals that Gabriel recognizes it as his co-worker’s phone and bravely pursues the voice in the sewers alone while Ryker keeps watch outside. <br><br>

After an amount of time, Vittorino finds Ryker and breaks the ladder leading up from the sewers, leaving Gabriel with no escape. Vittorino overpowers Ryker, crushing their ribs and begins to pull out their teeth. Ryker fades in and out of consciousness from the pain, and once they come back to fully, they attempt to escape when Accardi arrives and distracts Vittorino. <br><br>

Vittorino notices their escape, and they get chased to the attic. Once there, Ryker accidentally drops the Bible again and Vittorino picks it up. However, this time, upon reading, Vittorino’s eyes begin to bleed as the atmosphere changes entirely. Ryker opens their eyes to look right as Vittorino’s eyes explode, and he loses his vision entirely and runs away. <br><br>

<br><br>
        
Upon escaping the room, Ryker meets with Accardi who they asked for directions earlier, and they both proceed to make it out of the Basilica. They spend the night together drinking, and Accardi carries Ryker back to their motel room as they were too drunk to do it on their own.<br><br>

The next day, Accardi offers to help Ryker with trying to remove the Basilica curse by going to a shop that he believes could assist. Upon entering the shop, however, Ryker suddenly remembers the video and audio tapes they collected at the Basilica and during their dream state. While playing through these tapes, Ryker falls into another dream state, this time with Vittorino. Vittorino’s eyes seem to have healed partially, however its state regresses in the surreal landscape, and his right eye starts to melt again. Ryker is told by the Bible to spit in Vittorino’s eye to heal it, and it works. Ryker awakes from the dreamscape, and meets Accardi again outside.<br><br>

Accardi offers Ryker to hang out with one of his friends, and Ryker agrees, as Accardi mentions the friend knows multiple languages and might be able to translate items Ryker found in the Basilica. Upon arriving at said friend’s house, we find out it was the other person Accardi was with in his first appearance, Juliek. Juliek successfully translates the letters and Ryker leaves again. Accardi offers Ryker to stay at his place, and they accept. Falling asleep on the way there, Ryker falls into another dream and encounters beings that sound like their family. They beg for them to leave Rosso Cadere and return to France. Ryker refuses, and the angels begin to get more aggressive, demanding them to open the Bible, before Beetle comes and saves them.<br><br>

Ryker then wakes up in Accardi's house, and leaves to consult the shop they went to once again. Ryker burns one of the notes in their inventory, before returning to their motel. Once they enter, they are shocked to see Beetle. Beetle then knocks them out cold in order to get them into the dream reality. <br> <br>

Once in the dream reality, Ryker is dropped off and guided by a new angel, a deer with stitched together skin. They both enter a place called the Path of Equality, after solving some puzzles that give more context on Leon and Francis's background, Dante appears and shoots the deer. Ryker runs, however Dante appears in front of them and taunts Ryker into attacking him, before his form spontaenously combusts. <br><br>

As Ryker continues, they find Leon who is then attacked by Dante once again, who cuts two of Leon's fingers off, and then one of his own, which he then offers to Ryker. However, Ryker leaves with Leon's limp body. <br><br>

Upon entering the next room, Leon is once again fully aware and shows no signs of pain, before telling Ryker his death was a suicide, and shooting himself once again. As Ryker cradles his body like in the beginning, Dante once again offers his knife to Ryker as faceless angels surround them. 8:11 Chapter 1 ends at this scene, with Ryker resolving to find out the truth about Leon's death.
